# Future Work

## Enhancements
1. **Expanded Rule Set**: 
   - Add more diseases and symptoms to improve diagnostic accuracy.

2. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it more user-friendly.
   - Consider using frameworks like Tkinter or Flask for a web-based interface.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Implement a feature to save patient symptoms and diagnoses for future reference.

4. **Integration with Medical Databases**:
   - Integrate with online medical databases for up-to-date information on diseases and symptoms.

## Testing and Validation
1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Create more unit tests to cover edge cases and ensure reliability.
   - Use test-driven development (TDD) for future features.

2. **User Feedback**:
   - Collect feedback from healthcare professionals to refine the diagnostic rules and improve usability.

## Machine Learning Component
1. **Implement ML Models**:
   - Experiment with machine learning algorithms to predict diagnoses based on a larger dataset of symptoms and diagnoses.

2. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Explore reinforcement learning to optimize the diagnosis process based on user interactions.

## Documentation
1. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Expand the documentation to provide more detailed usage examples and installation instructions.

2. **Tutorials**:
   - Create video tutorials or written guides for new users.

By addressing these areas, the project can evolve into a more robust and useful tool for healthcare professionals.
