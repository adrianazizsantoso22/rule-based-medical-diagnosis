# Performance Evaluation

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline how the performance of the rule-based medical diagnosis system will be evaluated. This includes assessing its accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Accuracy**
   - Measure how accurately the system diagnoses diseases based on given symptoms.
   - Compare the system's diagnoses against a set of expert-reviewed diagnoses.

2. **Response Time**
   - Record the time taken by the system to process input symptoms and return diagnoses.
   - Aim for a response time of under 2 seconds for optimal user experience.

3. **User Feedback**
   - Gather feedback from users regarding the usability and effectiveness of the system.
   - Use surveys or interviews to collect qualitative data on user experience.

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Ensure that the unit tests cover at least 80% of the codebase.
   - Identify any critical paths or edge cases that need additional testing.

## Testing Procedure

1. **Create a Test Dataset**
   - Compile a dataset of symptoms and their corresponding diagnoses from reliable medical sources.

2. **Run Performance Tests**
   - Execute the application using the test dataset and measure accuracy and response time.
   - Document results for analysis.

3. **Analyze Results**
   - Review the performance metrics and user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
   - Make necessary adjustments to the rule set or application logic based on findings.

## Future Considerations
- As the system evolves, consider integrating machine learning algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and adapt to new medical knowledge.
- Regularly update the evaluation process to ensure it remains relevant and effective as new features are added.
